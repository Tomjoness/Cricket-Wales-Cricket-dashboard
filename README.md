# Cricket-Wales-Cricket-dashboard
This Power BI dashboard visualises performance data from real cricket matches Iâ€™ve analysed, turning raw CSV inputs into insights for player evaluation and match trends. It was built as a practical tool to support performance review and stakeholder reporting across live and post-match settings.

Tools Used:
Power BI, Excel, CSV Handling, GitHub


How to Use / How I Built This
	1.	Match data is collected manually or exported from scorekeeping software and stored as CSV files.
	2.	Data is cleaned and structured in Excel before being imported into Power BI.
	3.	In Power BI, I designed multiple visuals to track player performance (batting/bowling), partnerships, and momentum across overs.
	4.	The dashboard updates dynamically as new CSVs are loaded.
